Mission 1
- AI core possessed by indie world that's bargaining between League, TT and Hegemony for it
- smash and grab for it
	- story point option to get the local authority to lower security?
- bring it back to Remnant contact for money and rep
	- or defy Remnants and keep core

--------------------
Mission 2: Recover technology ("Fragments")
- go to abandoned station in <system>
- just outside the system is a wrecked Luddic Path capital
	- a Pather survivor is on board, rants about the abomination "you" wreaked on us
	- Deal with them appropriately, then salvage the wreck

- since we're using a Domain mothership, maybe it moved away from its original point?

- station is surrounded by wrecks, but seems partly operational
- investigate: find a researcher 
	- station was destroyed in the last attack, but the Luddic Path attackers also took catastrophic losses and had to fall back
	- some "unusual" things were found here
	- Was distress signal transmitted?
- enemy fleet approaches
	- If distress signal was not sent, it's a Luddic Path fleet back for round 2
	- If it was sent, it's a Tri-Tachyon fleet here to take possession
- player can demand to know what the special things are, or find out using technology skill
- it's a couple of Omega frigates
- can activate them to help with the defense; plug in an AI core to control them remotely
- now player has to either bail (losing the station) or fight off the enemies with or without the frigates
	- If it's a TT fleet, can negotiate to sell the station's contents to the corp, price is based on relative strength
	- after the battle, if the frigates were activated, they fly off to parts unknown
	- else they self-destruct
	- (it was the researcher who did it? depends on whether I want him to be a collaborator of Midnight or not)
		- Has to be, since he wouldn't have asked Midnight to send the player (unless Midnight knew what was going on and he didn't)
	- either way, there's some neat stuff in the station to salvage

--------------------
Mission 3: Brawl ("Showdown")
- early warning of Hegemony operation against Remnant station in <system>; Midnight asks for assistance
	- cooler implementation: target and staging area are unknown; player needs to follow a fleet joining the attack forces from a core world market
	- once the straggler spawns, need to get to destination within time limit
		- straggler is marked as ignores-others-except-player and others-ignore-me
		- DELIVER_X assignment to location marker
		- once it arrives, or when player approaches the system, other enemy fleets spawn
		- once it arrives, or some time after it's killed, enemy fleets (spawn if they haven't already and) go to target
- get to target system, huge brawl between Heg+Luddic and Remnant fleets (with mercs fighting for Remnants too?)
- objective is to ensure the station and neutralize all enemy fleets
	- alternative route: join the attack instead (will lead to losing Midnight as a contact, and put player on the anti-Remnant route long term)
		- Allied forces are operating from a staging area with base, if one of them sees the player they will pursue and interrogate
		- Use story point to persuade, or fight (this triggers the battle stage immediately)
		- player is asked to scout the Remnant system
		- Interact with marked point near station to summon the attack

--------------------
Mission 4: Salvation
mission requirements: Complete Remnant mission 3, be cooperative with Midnight Dissonant, [optional: Luddic Church has at least one size 5 or larger world, OR Gilead exists?]

Part 1: This boat has the means
- Suspected rogue Remnants attack a League planet, Midnight asks you to go investigate
- Go to planet, find that a military base was raided
- Agent Finlay Siyavong is there, tell him Midnight sent you in order to get answers
- It turns out a PK was stolen! >:O
    - The Remnant fleet that did this was badly damaged and fled to the fringe

Part 2: It will be done with reason from beginning to end
- Siyavong provides two leads?
- In one, you go to Rayan Arroyo to get info on TT-Remnant relations during the Second AI War
    - Maybe you meet in person, and then some <interesting thing> happens? I was thinking an assassination attempt text mini-quest (by Pathers, or Remnant kill-bots)
- For the other, try to follow the trail of the escaped Remnants
    - In a distant system you catch up with the mastermind of the plot, Mauve Towering
    - But it was just a decoy! After you win, he leaves a message taunting you and Midnight

Part 3: One million lives, gone
- Go back to Midnight with all the info
- She determines that Mauve plans to PK a high priority target, identifying Gilead [or whichever Luddic planet is appropriate, e.g. in random sector] as the most likely [based on 'psuedo-human intuition' from her past contacts with Mauve]
    - Mauve is an AIW1 veteran and was involved in clandestine communications with Tri-Tachyon during AIW2 [insert connection to Hanan Pacha incident here]
- Just in case, issue a general warning to the Sector that "rogue parties" are planning an attack on undetermined high-value worlds
- Player travels to the target world
- The Knights of Ludd don't want help defending their homeworld, persuade them otherwise (effect of failure: ?? should this even have a failure state?)
- Face Mauve's boss fleet in a final confrontation and take him down!
    - Or evil route: Let him PK Gilead and _then_ kill him (but letting him escape causes mission failure)
- WTB cool boss ship for this battle (preferably without relying on mods, but otherwise the SEEKER Nova or SWP sporeship might be perfect)
    - Maybe include Omega ships in the fleet as well?
- Do you get to recover the PK from the salvage? Teehee

Extra stuff:
- "midnight would keep your kind as pets out of misplaced sentimentality"
- Final words: say something defiant to Mauve or insult him for having a girl's name
- Siyavong says something like "it's only a matter of weeks, months on the outside, before an an alpha core cracks the quantum encryption. And the Remnants have plenty of alpha cores."
- "You let the Remnants have a PK!?"
