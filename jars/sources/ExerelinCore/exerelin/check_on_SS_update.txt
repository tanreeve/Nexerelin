0.96 notes:

Do on future SS release:
- Use "player colonized" and deciv listeners
	- Deciv listener applications:
		- Sector manager (faction elimination): useless, we don't know who the previous owner was
			- Just use it to run the live faction check
		- We do have a pre-deciv checker that works
	- Player colonized listener applications:
		- Faction setup nag script
	- But on the other hand the periodic check we already have works fine, don't fix what ain't broke
